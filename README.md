# Java Quick Start

Exercises are in `src` folder grouped by weeks.

```
src/
├── Main.java
├── week1/
│   ├── Name.java
│   :
├── week2/
:   ...
```

Execute individual files with `java src/<week>/<name>.java`. For example

>     java src/week1/Name.java

Execute all files with bash script `run_all.sh`

>     ./run_all.sh
